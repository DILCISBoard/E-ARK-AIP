# AIP specification (DEPRECATED)

This folder contains the the sources that were previously used to develop, publish and maintain the AIP specification.

Here you may find 3 folders:

- **01-Deprecated versions** - holds older versions of the documentation
- **02-Under development versions** - holds versions of the documentation that are still being worked on or under revision
- **03-Published versions** - holds the original source files of the specification that have been turned into official releases in PDF format.

If you find any issues on any version of the specification, please submit an issue here on GitHub at https://github.com/DLMArchivalStandardsBoard/E-ARK-AIP/issues/new
