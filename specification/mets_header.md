Note that while it is possible to validate requirement `AIPM2` for an individual AIP, requirement 
`AIPM1` refers to different versions of the AIP which could be separate information packages, 
possibly packaged as different ZIP or TAR archive files.

The specification of a concrete version of the METS profile is especially important for the AIP due 
to the potentially long retention period.
