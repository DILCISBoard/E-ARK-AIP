title:  E-ARK Archival Information Package (AIP)
subtitle: Specification for Archival Information Packages
abstract: |
        This E-ARK AIP format specification defines the requirements for building
        Archival Information Packages (AIPs) containing the information to be stored by
        an archive for the long term. While the AIP format inherits general properties
        from the “Common Specification for Information Packages” (CSIP), the
        difference to the Submission Information Package (SIP) and Dissemination
        Information Package (DIP) is the time dimension\: The AIP format defines a
        generic structure for storing both, a series of information packages, i.e.
        Submission Information Packages (SIPs), which were transferred at different,
        subsequent points in time, as well as any changes that needed to be applied for
        preservation reasons. The AIP format can therefore be seen as a wrapper for
        information packages which allows recording the provenance of the
        archival entity concerning changes and sequential submissions (SIPs) over time.
        Furthermore, an important requirement for creating manageable physical AIP
        packages is to limit the size of the AIPs. Therefore, the
        AIP specification defines a practice for splitting very large AIPs
        into multiple, sub-ordinated parts. Finally, the AIP specification gives a best
        practice recommendations regarding the physical packaging of AIPs.
