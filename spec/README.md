# AIP specification

In this folder you will find the sources that were used to develop, publish and maintain the official AIP specification by the DLM Archival Standards Board.

Here you may find 3 folders:

- **01-Deprecated versions** - holds older versions of the documentation
- **02-Under development versions** - holds versions of the documentation that are still being worked on or under revision
- **03-Published versions** - holds the original source files of the specification that have been turned into official releases in PDF format.

If you find any issues on any version of the specification, please submit an issue here on GitHub at https://github.com/DLMArchivalStandardsBoard/E-ARK-AIP/issues/new
